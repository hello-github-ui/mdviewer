Answer\nEven though both FileReader and FileInputStream are used to read data from a file in Java, they are quite different. The main difference between the FileReader and FileInputStream is that one reads data from a character stream while the other reads data from a byte stream. The FileReader automatically converts the raw bytes into characters by using the platform's default character encoding. This means you should use this class if you are reading from a text file that has the same character encoding as the default one."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If you happen to read a text file encoded in different character encoding then you should use InputStreamReader with specified character encoding.
